This script installs TF2C files for use in SFM.
Optionally it can also update SFM's TF2 files.

**Note:** Once installed, SFM will show TF2C files to be under the `tf` mod, *not* `tf2classic`. Despite this, you still have to enable the `tf2classic` search path in the SFM SDK.

## Requirements
* [TF2 Classic](https://tf2classic.com)
* [Source Filmmaker](https://www.sourcefilmmaker.com)
* **Linux:** [vpk](https://github.com/ValvePython/vpk)
* **Windows:** [HLExtract.exe](https://nemstools.github.io/pages/Miscellaneous-HLLib.html)

Optional:
* [Team Fortress 2](https://teamfortress.com)
